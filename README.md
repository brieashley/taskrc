# taskrc

Taskwarrior is Free and Open Source Software that manages your TODO list from the command line. It is flexible, fast, and unobtrusive. It does its job then gets out of your way. (taskwarrior.org)

This is my ~/.taskrc containing my preferred customizations. For optimal performance, use with terminator and solarized. Feel free to clone/fork and improve.
